We had a very pleasant bike to Stornoway and made such a good time we had to kill 2 hours before our transport back to Tarbert. We did this at Lews Castle, which was a good choice because it rained on and off and they had a generously sized entrance to keep us dry and warm.

Their cafe was not built for takeaway food though. We got coffee cups full of coleslaw and plastic containers with bread and packaged butter but no utensil to spread it.

Sadly, it was also the day of lost water bottles. Jack thankfully realized his was missing just after we got on the road. We got instructions to the castle from a passing gentleman after getting a bit turned around. The theory is I lost my water bottle here but we’ll never know since I didn’t realize it was gone till we reached the castle.

Finally, we went on to the Hub to meet Alistair for a van ride down to Tarbert. Alistair gave me a small round of applause when he saw I’d done the Hebridean Way on a mountain bike with 26 in tires. He’d never seen that before. The next most unlikely was a pair of 75-year-olds on folding bikes. Some day that might be us too.

Time flew by on the drive. Beautiful scenery and interesting chat with Alistair. He remembers when truly nothing was open on Sunday (most still isn’t). They even used to chain the swing sets and lock the merry-go rounds.

We got to the ferry in plenty of time. I had a nap on the way over. We both agreed later we should have eaten.

Our ride from Uig to Sligachan started a little after 6 pm and ended a little after 11 pm. We died somewhere around 10:30 pm.

The sun had gone down and we’d had a frantic Co-op stop in Portree because it was so late and nothing else was open and we were cold and didn’t want to hang around.

That last half hour of the bike in darkness and hunger with no real sense of remaining distance was as brutal as anything we’ve ever done.

On the plus side, we were immediately blown away by the beauty of Skye. We stopped at Kilt Rock coastline and waved at the Old Man of Storr as the sun was setting.

<summary>A hike to the Faerie Pools</summary>

Off-bike day activities included an 18km round trip hike from Sligachan Hotel to the Faerie Pools. Another exhausting but rewarding day. We saw no one on the hike there and not too many on the hike back. There are the most amazing hills all around throughout the journey, some grey and menacingly sharp-peaked, others green and pleasantly rounded.

We looped around the far end of the pools first. Moving closer to the car park meant more and more people. It was nice that we found some more secluded spots away from the crowd but really, even a crowd can’t ruin the experience.

The Faerie Pools are genuinely stunning. Clearwater rushing over falls, swirling about in eddies, and pooling invitingly in sheltered coves (yes, a few people were in the water).

10/10. Would highly recommend a visit.
