Luckily, our B&B owner was well-stocked for first aid and had two large bandages to spare. Jack said changing the bandage to this new one felt like changing out of 5-day-old underwear.

We had a beautiful ferry ride to Eriskay. Missed Bonnie Prince Charlieâ€™s beach (and the flowers that supposedly only grow there because a seed fell from his pocket). Stunning views of green-blue water and patches of shadow across our first Hebridean causeway.

We were doing alright till Daliburgh, where we stopped for lunch. Lunch wasn't the problem (we both had an excellent sweet potato soup). But the weather turned. We endured sideways rain and heavy downpours for the rest of the journey.

At one point, sheltered at a bus stop to have a snack, I realized how wet things were in my pockets. I had very much overestimated the waterproofness of my coat and underestimated the volume of Hebridean rain.

We biked pretty much straight on to Mornay B&B for warm showers and dry clothes. Our shoes are particularly soaked. Hopefully, they dry enough for a bit of walking tomorrow.

p.s. the medical centre was not open, we are still searching for bandages.
