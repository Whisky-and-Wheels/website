Jack says it takes 15.5 days to kill him. He is dead.

More accurately, he was dead about halfway through today’s ride but we managed to suffer through and catch the ferry anyway. I felt bad for him. I would have towed him if I could. I know things have gotten grim if he doesn’t even have the energy to complain. But we made it.

On the plus side, this ride had a lovely bike path running parallel to the main road for a significant stretch along the Sleat peninsula. This was particularly appreciated because there were a good number of large vehicles speeding along the road to and from the ferry. Biking alongside transport trucks is never fun.

If we come back to this part of Scotland (and we’d like to), I would want to find more routes that keep us off the main roads.
