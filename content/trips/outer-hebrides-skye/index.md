We've never had particularly graceful departures, but this one was the roughest yet: our bikes were vandalised two days before the trip and Jack had a terrible fall in the rain the morning of our first travel day.  

But the bikes survived (and so did Jack)!

We don't often remember the rocky start when we look back on this trip. The views throughout the Outer Hebrides and Skye have a way of taking your mind off everything else.
