We had planned a longer stay in Leverburgh to leave time for the two-day window required when booking a St. Kilda trip. Unfortunately, the winds were too strong on both days, so the trip was canceled.

After hearing the disappointing news, one of our B&B hosts, Polly, brought out a little Puffin stuffy, saying she wanted me to see a Puffin, which was very sweet. Apparently, her mum is puffin-mad and they have all sorts of Puffin-themed things about. As it happened, this was the only puffin I saw on the trip.

A very blustery start to the day. We saw lots of great holiday cottages and clamping pods along the way to Tarbert. The wind made it tough at points but the views were incredible.

We detoured out to Luskentyre Beach, which was as stunning as advertised but distinctly lacking in cafes. Later, we arrived at Harris Hotel just after they stopped serving lunch.

On a cold walk out to the city, we saw the Isle of Harris distillery had a cafe. But it was closed this week because they needed all staff to work on bottling whisky for an upcoming launch (they currently only served gin).

The last stop was an outdoor takeaway called Lornaâ€™s. Success. We had soups and a shared portion of chips. Enough to tide us over until dinner.

At the hotel, I was delighted to find our room had a bathtub and took full advantage.
