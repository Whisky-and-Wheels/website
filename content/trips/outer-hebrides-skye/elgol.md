Ride from Sligachan to Broadford mostly good but busy. Weather great. Roads relatively flat, if a little more single track than I like.

One section was very strange. A police car parked diagonally across the two lanes and started instructing every oncoming car to pull aside and wait. We were riding behind him, so it looked like we had a police escort. Jack found this hilarious. I was deeply unsettled. One car applauded for us.

When we stopped at Siaway for a lunch break, we learned the reason. A vehicle with an abnormal load (large circular thing protruding beyond a single lane of traffic) came through and things returned to normal after that.

We also randomly saw a Formula One type car. It was an odd day.

Broadford to Elgol was much quieter, away from main traffic on the peninsula. Towards the end of the ride, we hit some big hills and I stopped near the top of one, next to a cemetery, waiting for Jack.

As he approached, I gave him an encouraging smile and said, “We’re nearly there!”

He nodded at the graveyard in reply: “We’re nearly *there*.”

Coriusk House food is as delicious as I remember (delicious enough to forget the wifi is spotty). Dinner was a 2-hour affair of four courses:
- Chanterelle soup
- Smoked haddock mousse, scallop and langoustine
- Braised ox tail, filet of beef, fondant potato, celeriac
- Almond biscuit, poached blackberry, wildflower creme brûlée

We also enjoyed the world’s best freshly-baked walnut bread and poppy seed loaf. Jack’s eyes went wide with every dish. But we were both struggling to stay awake by the end. Planning naps before dinner for tomorrow.

<summary>A hike to Sgurr na stri</summary>

We booked a half-day round-trip with the Bella Jane to visit Loch Coriusk. Once there, we set off on a hike to Sgurr na Stri but ran into a lot of difficulty finding (and staying on!) the right path. Unlike the clearly marked single trail for the Faerie Pools, there were several gravel paths one could follow around Loch Coriusk and we kept veering off our planned route.

At one point, trying to cross a flat rock with a wet patch, I slipped and slid downwards. Jack reached up to catch me. Unfortunately, the sudden stop bent my knee in a direction knees are not meant to bend. We didn’t slide any further though, and the knee (while sore) was OK to walk on.

We found a path that had fewer big flat rocks to cross and made good progress up the hill. The views in every direction were incredible. We were finally on a good clear stretch when we checked the time and realized there was no way we would make it back to the boat by 3pm if we continued to the end of our scheduled route.

Realistic decision-making had to trump idealistic planning. We marked the end of our journey with a lunch break overlooking the Cuillin Hills and turned back. We weren’t even sure our early exit would guarantee arriving back in time. As we rushed down the hills, Jack turned his ankle.

It was bad but not hopeless. Jack took a short break, tied his shoe tightly, and carried on. We did better staying on the good path but were still unsure at most junctions which way to go.

Thankfully, a family of three from Aberdeen was hiking back to meet the boat at the same time. We chatted a bit as they passed and it seemed prudent to follow them as they were quite confident in their path choices. They were also incredibly quick. We lost sight of them a few times but managed to get back in time to catch the boat.

Next time, we'll definitely take the full-day trip option.
