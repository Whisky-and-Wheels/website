Harris Hotel was very nice. Wish we had an extra day there, especially since they had a laundry service and we are constantly dirtying our clothes quicker than we can clean them.

Monster hill to start the day. Eleven hills total over 60km, which is a long, tiring day for us whatever the weather. As it happened, the weather was kind: sunny and no wind.

We both confused an old lady at the Kinloch Historical Society cafe by going in separately and ordering for two.

Can I have tea and coffee?<br>

Both.

Found a shipping container pizza shop at a beautiful location outside of Stornoway. Top-quality pizza too. It was a bit early for dinner but we shared one anyway.

The next question was what to do for actual dinner. There was a visitor centre cafe in Callanish but we didn’t fancy racing to it before it closed at 4pm. Luckily, Jack remembered some straps we weren’t using and we were able to secure another pizza to the back of my bike for takeaway. 

One of the great benefits of staying at Callanish is that you can walk to the stone circles any time you like. This means you can find quieter times away from the big coach bus groups. Stone Circle 1 is the biggest, with the visitor centre. We visited twice at off-hours and the experience was magical.
