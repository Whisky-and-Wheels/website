Surprisingly catastrophe-free journey from Glasgow to Barra. Train on time. Ferry on time. Not a terribly long bike to North Bay. Not too rainy. And a *fantastic* dinner at Tigh Grianach.

Ham and lentil soup with crusty bread is what we ordered. Then we got bonus cheese! Delicious and filling, but not pub filling.

The other wonderful thing about the B&B is the library! Our room is stocked with Paddington, Calvin & Hobbes, Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie and more. Wish we were staying a week.

The ferry over was a solid 5 hours. When we got into the Hebridean Sea, you had to have good sea legs to walk around (Jack did not). When I went to fill our water bottles at the downstairs cafe, I heard one poor soul retching over and over into a paper bag. It was not a journey for the faint of stomach.

The Outer Hebrides are beautiful from the moment you step off the ferry. Very wind-tossed and rugged. All mossy rock and heather. We passed a shining white sand beach on the way to our accommodation. Seeing the waves break around the shore is mesmerizing.

The hardest part at the moment is finding new first aid supplies for Jackâ€™s knee and elbow. We have one more bandaid for his elbow, but no more wound pads for his knee and no way to get them until we pass a medical centre on North Uist. Tomorrow could be a very long day.
