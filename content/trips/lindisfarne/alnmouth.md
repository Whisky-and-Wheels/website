The day started fine. We were on the road close to 9h and, thanks to some great declines, were averaging about 18km/h when we reached Bamburgh.

Bamburgh castle is huge and cuts an impressive figure on the focky hilltop overlooking the sea.

We wished we could have stayed longer. If I were to do this again, I would have us stay overnight in Bamburgh.

We hurried on to our lunch stop at Seahouses. I thought we'd be OK as long as we left by 12h30. Two hours to go 30km seemed reasonable. I had not factored in the wind, but we'll get to that later.

We struggled to find a place to eat. Many places were closed. Neptune's Fish & Chips was the winner.

Back on the road, the wind started working against us. I felt completely out of energy by 14h but was determined not to miss another train.

We decided to skip the planned off-road coastal portion of the ride and stuck to the road. This made the journey longer and, although we were on a better surface, it didn't feel like we were getting much more protection from the wind.

Desperately tired and defeated, we limped to Alnmouth ten minutes late for our train - only to find the train station wasn't actually properly marked at the end of our route. We were still several kilometres away from it.

A solid 45 minutes late in the end. Good thing our LNER train was running over an hour late :)
