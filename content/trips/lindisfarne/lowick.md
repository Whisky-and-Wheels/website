Almost perfect.

We left Hamsterley in good time. There wasn't too much snow. Train to Berwick was almost empty. An hour's journey later, we were ready to begin our bike.

It was cold. Even with my winter cycling gloves. The tips of my fingers were numb and what I could feel was tingly and painful.

All that said, the bike to Lindisfarne was beautiful: waves rolling into shore, birds chirping, dogs playing on the beach.

When off asphalt, it was hard to take in anything but the ten feet in front of you. The ground was still wet and had dangerous mud grooves from vehicles and other bikes. Poor Jack fell twice, which is highly unusual for him (falling is more _my_ thing).

The highlight was the bike along the causeway, which is level with what becomes seabed twice a day. It was otherworldly.

I have to find out what that windswept plant is. From a distance, the hills looked like rock but close up, they were covered in this pale yellow flora.

Cafe stop for cheese scones and rock hard butter. We were happy to be under a warming light and the hot drinks brought feeling back to our fingers.

[Priory Museum](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/) was small but interesting and the ruins were impressive. We probably could have spent an hour with the friendly lady in the entrance booth. She told us that the landowner had sold the lead from the roof of the priory in the 1600s and that was when it really started to fall apart. Perhaps as karma, the lead shipment sank and the landowner was never paid for it.

Short bike over to the castle brought the best views. We got a preview of tomorrow's castle: Bamburgh.

Since the causeway would no longer be safe by 17h, we decided to head out early (around 13:30) and go on to the pub hotel.

We hit our only significant hills on the part of the journey and it was quite devastating to arrive early only to find the pub was closed till 16:30.

We had two hours to kill in the cold outdoors. We sheltered in a bus stop on the main street. It didn't offer much shelter but at least we were motivated to do some stretches to stay warm. Hopefully that will pay off tomorrow.

Online searching showed the only other pub in the vicinity opened at 16h. We walked up together and went in as it opened. It was a small but lively place, felt like a good example of British pub community. One couple sat down to share a booth with a fellow they didn't know. I could hear them talking about the rugby that was playing on TV.

There was also an old dog in the pub (maybe a spaniel?). She was desperate to make friends. Sometimes she'd be lying on the floor and look dead to the world except for a furiously thumping tail. Two patrons gave her much appreciated scratches.

We had two whisky drams of unremembered age: Highland Park and [Jura (pronunciation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz_ZTwrv0Jk&list=PL6TwbysAXiWKQfv9GFWwsGhyjeMDShAqp&index=29). Both good, but we both preferred Jura.
