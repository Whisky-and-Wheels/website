Almost perfect.

We left Hamsterley in good time. There wasn't too much snow. The train to Berwick was almost empty. An hour's journey later, we were ready to begin our bike.

It was cold. Even with my winter cycling gloves. The tips of my fingers were numb and what I could feel was tingly and painful.

That said, the bike to Lindisfarne was beautiful. Waves rolling into shore, birds chirping, dogs playing on the beach...

When off asphalt, it was hard to take in anything but the ten feet in front of you. The ground was still wet and had dangerous mud grooves from vehicles and other bikes. Poor Jack fell twice, which is highly unusual for him (falling is more _my_ thing).

The highlight was the bike along the causeway, which is level with what becomes seabed twice a day. It was otherworldly.

I have to find out what that windswept plant is. From a distance, the hills looked like rock but close up, they were covered in this pale yellow flora.

Cafe stop for cheese scones and rock-hard butter ([Pilgrims Coffee House & Roastery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLnkCpXLhUuVCEWt9)). We were happy to be under a warming light and had hot drinks to bring feeling back to our fingers.

[The Priory Museum](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/lindisfarne-priory/) was small but interesting and the ruins were impressive. We probably could have spent an hour with the friendly lady in the entrance booth. She told us that the landowner had sold the lead from the roof of the priory in the 1600s and that was when it really started to fall apart. Perhaps as karma, the lead shipment sank and the landowner was never paid for it.

<summary>The Holy Island</summary>

Lindisfarne is a tidal island located on the northeast coast of England. The island was famous for its saint bishop, Saint Cuthbert. In 793 the Vikings raided the island, which was the first recorded raid in England (Archeological record shows that there had been much earlier visits by Vikings to Shetland and the Outer Hebrides.). The monks that have left the island after continuous raids have first founded the church in Chester-le-Street and then founded the Durham Cathedral. According to the story (by an elderly tour guide at the Durham Cathedral), while trying to find a resting place for St. Cuthbert's bones, a cow led the monks to the location where the Cathedral stands to this day. Perhaps that's the reason why the street is called Dun Cow Lane. This is not very unrealistic tho, at the time this region was full of cattle herders.

Lindisfarne has also been featured in the historic fiction show [Vikings](https://www.history.com/shows/vikings)](<https://www.history.com/shows/vikings>).

A short bike over to the castle brought the best views. We got a preview of tomorrow's castle: [Bamburgh](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HpWBodX4cUvMppdq5).

Since the causeway would no longer be safe by 17h, we decided to head out early (around 13:30) and go on to the pub hotel.

We hit our only significant hills on this part of the journey and it was quite devastating to arrive early only to find the pub was closed till 16:30 ([The White Swan Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9CvE79oFTFM4fp6y5)).

We had two hours to kill in the cold outdoors. We sheltered in a bus stop on the main street. It was very difficult but at least we were motivated to do some stretches to stay warm. Hopefully, that will pay off tomorrow.

Online searching showed the only other pub in the vicinity opened at 16h ([The Black Bull Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RvDNp8YJXvwM6yGJ8)). We walked up together and went in as it opened. It was a small but lively place. One couple sat down to share a booth with a fellow they didn't know. I could hear them talking about the rugby that was on the TV.

There was also an old dog in the pub (maybe a spaniel?). She was desperate to make friends. Sometimes she'd be lying on the floor and look dead to the world except for a furiously thumping tail. Two patrons gave her much appreciated scratches.
