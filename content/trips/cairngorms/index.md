This was a delightful series of mistakes we will never forget.<!-- excerpt --> We got engaged in Edinburgh and wanted to see more of Scotland for a honeymoon trip. But we couldn't decide on a single location for the trip.

In the end, we picked a general area, the [Cairngorms](https://www.visitcairngorms.com/), and planned an ambitious bike trip around it. We had only done a few weekend trips at this point, with no experience biking in Scottish hills. Normally, we aim for 50km on a bike day but we tried to avoid over 30km most days for this trip (with one spectacular failure in this regard).

We were very careless with several crucial factors:

<summary>Elevation</summary>

You will encounter a lot of hills in Scotland. Some of them will be gentle, rolling hills I like to call _carousel hills_. These are quite enjoyable because you get a lot of momentum from the descent of the previous hill and are halfway up the next one before you have to pedal again.

Other hills are there for you to die on. They go forever with false flats or torture you with short, steep gradients or present a diabolical combination of the two that will make you question every decision in your life that led you to this point.

There's not much you can do about the murder hills other than mentally prepare for a bad time and look for a good cafe at the top or along the descent.

<summary>Surfaces</summary>

You don't go as fast on dirt or gravel as you do on asphalt. Sounds obvious now. But I don't think we even looked at surfaces when planning this trip. We went to Google Maps, put in a start and end location, clicked the little bike icon and assumed everything would be fine. _Surely Google wouldn't put us on a mountain bike trail in the middle of nowhere?_ (see Dalmunzie, Day 1)

_Well, at least it wouldn't expect us to be on busy A-roads with giant logging trucks zooming past?_ (see Ballater, Day 3) Yes, the other thing to keep in mind with surfaces is whether the smooth, well-maintained asphalt is worth the highway traffic that comes with it. Given the choice, I'll take the quieter, bumpier B-road any day.

<details class="stack">
<summary>Wind</summary>

A lot of well-known bike routes come with suggestions of the direction to travel in based on prevailing wind patterns. This is nothing to sniff at. A tailwind (pushing you forwards) offers a welcome boost while a headwind (pushing you backwards) can double your expected travel duration.

The more exposed you are, the stronger the wind will be. We learned this lesson repeatedly on multiple ski hills. A strong Scottish wind, regardless of direction, will be loud and cold. Bring layers and consider a headband or buff to cover your ears if you value your hearing.

Quite frankly, most bike days on this trip were a disaster. But we would both do it again in a heartbeat.
