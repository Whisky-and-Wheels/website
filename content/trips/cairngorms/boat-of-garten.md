Too tired for full sentences. Bullet points only:

- Off at 10h30-ish
- High, windy biking
- Fast, fancy cars
- Nice forest section
- Jack wants new legs
- Boat of Garten! Drop bags
- Buy train tickets to Aviemore (pronounced _Ah-vee-more_)
- Round trip Aviemore to Broomhill (with tea and extra scones!)
- 40min bike back, off road bits otherworldly
- Bikes stored
- Dinner 18h45
