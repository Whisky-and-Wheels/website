My back tire punctured somewhere on the way home from the [House of Bruar](https://www.houseofbruar.com/the-house-of-bruar-restaurant/) yesterday. It was totally flat when we collected the bikes to check out of Atholl Arms.

Relatively easy ride to Pitlochry (once Jack pumped my tire back to life). I passed Jack going up a hill. Man watching from the bus stop told him he would need a motor to keep up with me. Jack said he wanted to tie a rope to my bike and get towed.

Drinks and lunch at [Old Mill Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yJciK3L9YMKQ4DvA9) (not a working mill, Jack noted with disappointment). We wandered over to the station early and I bought some books from the [second-hand bookshop](https://www.pitlochrystationbookshop.co.uk/).

Devastation upon the train’s arrival. It was packed. People sitting all over our cycle rack. An old lady disembarking took one look at our bikes, laughed, and muttered, “Not a chance.”

The apologetic and frazzled conductor said he had not an inch of space. He’d phone ahead to the next train to ask for room for us.

We were stranded. The ticket office closed early. Jack was on the phone with Scotrail and I was on the phone with the Pitlochry tourist office to hear if there were any other options to Edinburgh. In the end, after an extremely long and stressful wait, we were able to get on an indirect train and spent the night as expected in Market Street Hotel.

We were both a bit overwhelmed by the noise and size of Edinburgh after two weeks of relatively quiet countryside.

On arriving back home in Durham the next day, I was pleased to remember we had stocked the freezer with a ready-made pizza. We ate it immediately, looked at each other, and decided to order Domino's as well.
