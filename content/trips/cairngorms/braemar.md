We climbed another mountain today. At least this time it was on road.

Stopped at Glenshee Ski Centre for [Tea @ the Shee](https://www.ski-glenshee.co.uk/Tea-The-Shee-Cafe). Two old goldens at picnic bench next to ours. They couldnâ€™t have been happier to climb the mountain themselves. Terminally good-natured dogs.

Descent into Braemar was unreal. Layers of mountains like a painting. Green and yellow in the foreground. Blue and purple in the distance. A perfect little stream running alongside the road.

Busier road than usual. We did turn off the highway to continue following the Old Military Road, but it was a moment of trepidation considering all Google Maps put us through Saturday.
