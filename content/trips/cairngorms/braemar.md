We climbed another mountain today. At least this time it was on the road.

Stopped at Glenshee Ski Centre for [Tea @ the Shee](https://www.ski-glenshee.co.uk/Tea-The-Shee-Cafe). Two old goldens at the picnic bench next to ours. They couldnâ€™t have been happier to climb the mountain themselves. Terminally good-natured dogs.

Descent into Braemar was unreal. Layers of mountains like a painting. Green and yellow in the foreground. Blue and purple in the distance. A perfect little stream running alongside the road.

Busier road than usual. We did turn off the highway to continue following the Old Military Road, but it was a moment of trepidation considering all Google Maps put us through Saturday.

<summary>The Old Military Road</summary>

The Old Military Road in the Scottish Highlands was constructed around mid 18th century by the British army to be able to control the clans after the (second) Jacobite rebellion of 1715. The road starts from the central lowlands and stretches to the Inverness with fortified barracks. It was, perhaps, most famously used to expedite Bonnie Prince Charlie's Jacobite army's descent towards London in 1744-45.

We spend our rest day walking along the river paths and watch the Clunie Water from [The Bothy Braemar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fiL9GXdjF3g9SA2p8). We were unable to go into the [Braemar castle](https://www.braemarcastle.co.uk), as it was closed on that day. For dinner we ended up going to the only place that was open and did not require any reservations, [Farquharson's Bar and Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xzyFWP39CzMzaZjS8) where we had the most unexpected and delicious cheesecake ever.
