This was the result of some bad luck.

Our original accommodation in Dalwhinnie called about a month before the trip to tell us they were going out of business. They suggested a few other options in the area but those were already fully booked.

There were lots of options if we wanted to stop further North, but we had to catch a train on our last day, so decided to push on South.

We left closer to 10h than 9h30. Jack immediately felt weak. Not sore. Just not able to push pedals at all. I didn’t know what to do about this other than go slow and take breaks as needed.

We reached Newtonmore around 12h30 and couldn’t pass up the opportunity to visit the [Highland Folk Museum](https://www.highlifehighland.com/highlandfolkmuseum/) on such a sunny day. We walked to the older part of the museum and a poor volunteer in period clothes greeted us. I say poor because he was sitting in the sun and it was extremely hot. He already had the beginnings of a sunburn.

There were no plaques on the exhibits so it was great to have him give us the rundown of what we were looking at. And extra info on those distinctive roofs (made of heather because it sticks like velcro, and sloped steeply to serve as both roof and walls to avoid snow accumulation). It was incredibly dark inside. Jack needed to use his phone flashlight to see the details of the beds and cookery.

We got back on the road and arrived at Dalwhinnie Distillery around 15h30. Jack was still having a lot of trouble.

I bought a small 15-year Dalwhinnie to taste later and went down the road to the Snack Shack, which was easily our most disappointing pit stop. However, it seemed to give Jack his second wind (eventually).

We were assisted by several long downhill slopes. The weather remained beautiful and we had some excellent views of the mountains and a winding river and horse pastures.

The best view of all, of course, was Atholl Arms at the end of the day. We were both thoroughly exhausted.
