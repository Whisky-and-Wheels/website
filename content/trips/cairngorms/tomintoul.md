Not terribly difficult first peak on way to [Tomintoul (pronunciation)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl_1enZk-so). True test of strength and stamina (and wind resistance) was over the second peak, [Lecht ski hills](https://www.lecht.co.uk/about-the-lecht).

Clouded over, windy, and threatening a storm. We thought we reached the top only to find a slight decline followed by another peak.

Stopped at Lecht cafe (highest roadside bar in Scotland, according to the sign out front) for much-needed hot drinks and Jackâ€™s treat: donuts.

Downhill rest of the way. But with the wind, you still had to pedal! Wild. Unforgettable.

We were unable to find a place to warm up in Tomintoul with the bikes so went a little early to our accommodation, a quiet, secluded spot which was worth every foot of elevation.

We even got a beautiful rainbow on arrival.
