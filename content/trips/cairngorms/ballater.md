Difficult ride to Balmoral. Jack was miles ahead of me the whole way and it was a busy road (logging trucks are _the worst_). The views were stunning as usual. And the elevation changes were not too severe. I had to ask Jack to slow down, which he sort of did and I sort of felt better.

Sadly, when we got to [Balmoral Castle](https://www.balmoralcastle.com), there was nothing to see from the public entrance. One would have to pay the entrance fee, find a place to lock bikes and check or carry bags. Not gonna happen. Rain started getting heavier so we added splash pants. It was a good call. Rained on and off for the rest of our ride.

We tried to stop at another castle on the way to Ballater but it was on private property. 0 for 2.

That said, we made a great time to Ballater, arriving around 13h after having left at 10h30. Definitely a good idea to avoid the massive inclines we would have faced going direct from Braemar to Candacraig.

Ballater is bigger than Braemar. More restaurants and cafes. More sprawl of commercial streets.

We got lunch takeaway from a butcher’s called [Sheridan’s](https://maps.app.goo.gl/miWHgEqXAp1aXhnx6). Luckily there was a friendly bike shop with nice outdoor seating where we had our lunch, [Cycle Highlands](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F5tFnBkseGScUVBp9). I was tempted by [Shorty’s ice cream](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BFSQf9m6Ei1HmdvE8) but it was too cold. Then we found a cafe with outdoor seating, Rocksalt & Snails (at the time we write this it seems like their cafe is permanently closed). Bailey’s hot chocolate with cream and marshmallows for me. Cappuccino for Jack. Jack was still craving cheesecake so I got the only one on offer: lemon meringue. Not quite as good as the honeycomb one from Farquharson's in Braemar the night before.

On the way from Ballater to Candacraig, we immediately overheated and felt sick. The sweaters came off. The cheesecake was regretted. There wasn’t a ton of incline, but there was enough and we walked a good portion of it on cold, tired, sore legs.

We lucked out the next day. Even though the regular Highland Games were canceled due to COVID, there was a community version that was equal parts exciting and heartwarming.
