We barely survived the first ride. Google Maps took us off road for the last 12km or so. We had done very well with the first 20km on undulating and zigzagging asphalt road. We were completely unprepared for the [Cateran trail](https://www.pkct.org/cateran-trail).

"Trail" is a generous word. There were occasional signposts and the merest wisp of a path through the grass. For two hours we saw nothing but mountains and no one but sheep.

Panic set in around 18h. We were spent, legs and arms aching from pushing our bikes up this can-you-even-call-it-a-path. Google Maps started to diverge from the signposts. We had no idea where to go and the clouds rolled in again, threatening downpour.

Jack made the call to ignore Google and stick to the marked trail, which was wise. I reached the signpost we had designated as a re-grouping point first. I called Dalmunzie, our hotel.

There are no words to express the relief I felt when I told the receptionist we were on the Cateran trail and she said, “Oh, I know exactly where you are.” That made one of us. We had stopped about 30ft from the peak and on the other side, a rocky downhill slope led to the road and Dalmunzie hotel.

It was still rough going but we knew where we were and that made a world of difference for me (Jack was too exhausted to do anything but put one foot in front of the other, I can’t blame him).

We limped to Dalmunzie. Jack collapsed on the grass outside and I went to reception to check-in. When I came out, he was still on the ground. I said the warranty on a new husband must still be good. I should trade him in for a newer model. He said they wouldn't take him back. User fault.
