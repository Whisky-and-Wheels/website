We rushed to Durham train station (lucky we had reservations, another biker was refused access). Short but crowded ride to Newcastle. Jack stayed with the bikes.

We waited about 20 minutes for the Northern train to Hexham (no bike reservations available, first-come, first-served). Again, crowded platform. We didn't know where the bikes would go and had to wait until the train arrived to find a bike sticker on one of the cars. We were the first bikers on and squished in so one other bike could join. About an hour's peace before arriving in Hexham.

For the ride to Twice Brewed Inn, we had mostly quiet country roads with a bit more incline than we were really prepared to encounter. The setting sun was a beautiful sight. We rode mostly in twilight. Very meditative. The rain held off, which was much appreciated.

We were very cold and tired when we arrived. Dinner was a half-pint and full pizza for me. Full pint and triple burger for Jack. I hope I never forget the expression on his face when he was trying to figure out how it could fit in his mouth.
