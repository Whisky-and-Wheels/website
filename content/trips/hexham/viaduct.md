Slow out of bed. Jack was still full from last night's dinner but insisted on having a full Northumbrian breakfast "for tradition".

We set out for the Lambley Viaduct, which didn't disappoint. Took a little exploring to figure out how to get to the river level. We had to lock up the bikes and take the stairs. There was an old narrow bridge over the Tyne river that got the best view of the Viaduct.

Unfortunately, standing still for too long put a chill in us. I could barely feel my fingers most of the ride back. The sun peeked out just in time to warm us up and give us a second wind to visit [Vindolanda](https://www.vindolanda.com/roman-vindolanda-fort-museum).

Tricksy sun then disappeared and we nearly froze trying to eat our Co-op sandwiches in the courtyard (Ham & Cheese, classic). Started pouring rain at that point too. We rushed down to warm up at the cafe. I quite like the special Northumbrian blend tea.

The museum attached to the cafe was excellent. They've found so much stuff on this site! It was not so pleasant walking back through the ruins in the wind and cold but I'm glad we went.

No energy left to visit Sycamore Gap before dinner. Discovered a delicious cherry stout beer called Nox (picked up a few more bottles for home consumption). Then it was time for the main event: stargazing!

Now, it had been a very cloudy, occasionally rainy day, so expectations were low. But Wil (host, astronomical fellow) and Thea (his assistant, electrical engineer by day) put on a great event.

Outside, in the beginning, there were a few gaps in the cloud and we looked at:

- Earth's moon
- companion stars
- a star cluster
- a nebula
- Mars

Suddenly, the clouds completely lifted for about 10 minutes. It was magical. But it couldn't last.

We returned inside and it started to rain again. Wil ran out to take care of the seven telescopes at the top of the hill. When he came back, he somewhat guiltily said he would leave the fourteen at the bottom to Thea.

As if on cue, Thea ran in seconds later, damp and out of breath - she'd already covered the bottom telescopes.

I heard you shouting and I thought no problem, I'll just do these fourteen on my own.
