We got up for an early breakfast because we wanted to walk to the Sycamore Gap\* before checkout. On the way there, we walked along Hadrian's wall. Sometimes up some very steep, rocky steps.

We descended to the foretold gap. The sycamore tree is truly lovely. Also known as the Robin Hood tree for featuring in a movie where Kevin Costner has a baffling accent (non-accent? I don't know what was going on there).

On the way back, we took the flat path, but it was very swampy. I stepped on what I thought was a rock and almost lost a shoe sinking into ankle-deep mud.

The bike ride to Newcastle was a bit hectic after our lunch stop in Hexham, because it had taken us about 2 times longer than I had estimated to reach that point. We were rushing to make the 16:36 train.

Very skillful navigating by Jack through Newcastle City Center. We arrived, exhausted but triumphant, at 16:28 - only to look at the departure board and realize there _was_ no 16:36 train.

I had misremembered the time. Our train was actually at 16:26. We'd missed it by two minutes. Devastating.

Thankfully, there are lots of trains from Newcastle to Durham on any given day, so all was not lost, But was a long, cold wait in the open air station for the 17:30 train.

**_Postscript_**: _Sadly, the beautiful old Sycamore was felled in September 2023 (reasons and perpetrators unknown as of the time of writing, February 2024)._
