A good night's sleep makes a world of difference. We both wished we had planned to stay longer. Loch Lomond was otherworldly beautiful.

We had planned a ridiculously large time buffer to catch a train from Glasgow to Edinburgh (our history with catching trains is spotty). That meant we were able to enjoy a leisurely ride from Balloch to Glasgow.

Again, a delightful amount of cycle path and hardly any elevation to speak of. National Cycle Route 7 is highly recommended.
