A good night's sleep made a world of difference. We both wished we could stay longer and have more time to explore.

Given that our history with catching trains is spotty (see [Hexham, Bike Day 3](./trips/hexham/#bike-day-3) and [Lindisfarne, Bike Day 2](./trips/loch-lomond/#bike-day-2)), we gave ourselves a ridiculously large time buffer to catch a train from Glasgow to Edinburgh.

Again, a delightful amount of dedicated cycle path and hardly any elevation. We enjoyed a leisurely ride. This stretch of [National Cycle Route 7](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/find-a-route-on-the-national-cycle-network/route-7/) highly recommended.
