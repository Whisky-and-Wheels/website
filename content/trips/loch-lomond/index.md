The banks of Loch Lomond are still bonnie when one has a cold, but that's not much comfort.<!-- excerpt --> No idea what we'll actually write, but need some content to grab for excerpt on all trips landing page.

We stayed at a beautiful B&B in Balloch, which offered a lovely breakfast (but no full Scottish, which Jack prefers).

The lady told us that cows have no concept of Daylight Savings, so they have to start milking them slightly earlier each day in the week leading up to the jump.

Gorgeous mountain view from room.

We had a cafe break outdoors from an adorable coffee truck in a location that also provides a Fairie Trail for kids.

The ride along Loch Lomond was breathtakingly beautiful. Overcast skies but no rain (yet). Mostly flat. Proper cycle path. No sharing with cars. Highly recommended.

We thought about taking a ferry to the other side of the Loch but our timing didn't work out.

Lunch from a tourist centre with a cafe. (Bonnie and Ben takeaway)

Then we went in search of a dam that looked like the one in Andor.

Elevation was tough. It started raining and didn't stop.

On the way back I was miserable. Sick and cold and tired.

We picked up dinner at the co-op and collapsed back at the B&B

Great journey to Glasgow along National Cycle Path 7.
