The banks of Loch Lomond are still bonnie when one has a cold, but that's not much comfort.<!-- excerpt --> This was a tough one.

We had been in Paris during the week for Jack's work. We weren't sure the trains would run to get us to the airport Friday morning, but they did.

It was a whirlwind day of travel and un-packing and re-packing and more travel. We arrived in Balloch after dark and rode a short ways to the B&B.
