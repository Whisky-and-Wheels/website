The banks of Loch Lomond are still bonnie when one has a cold, but that's not much comfort.<!-- excerpt --> This was a tough one.

We had been in Paris during the week for Jack's work. There was lots of talk of train strikes for the day we were scheduled to fly out.

Thankfully, the trains ran and the flight was on time and we were back in Durham before we knew it.

But it was a whirlwind day of travel and un-packing and re-packing and more travel. We arrived in Balloch after dark and rode a short ways to the B&B.
