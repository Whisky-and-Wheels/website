We woke up to a beautiful view of mountains, and a lovely breakfast delivered to the room (unfortunately for Jack, the full Scottish was not on offer). It was the weekend of Daylight Savings and our B&B was on a farm. The owner told us they'd been milking the cows slightly earlier each day throughout the week to prepare for the jump. It turns out cowies do get mad when you milk them at different times.

We were up early, excited for a bike along Loch Lomond, but still tired from yesterday's travel. I was also recovering from getting sick earlier in the week.

But we couldn't have dreamed up a better ride for the first half of the day. There's a proper cycle path along the loch, so no worries about cars. And it's mostly flat! The weather was overcast but not rainy. the clouds in Scotland are works of art.

We stopped for tea and coffee at an adorable little blue coffee truck in a location that also had a unicorn sculpture and a map of a fairie trail ([Sassanach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gJtydQg2yafoJ4Vq9)).

Lunch was at a tourist centre with a cafe ([Bonnie & Ben Takeaway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zc6CviTWsxAJShSaA)). We thought about taking a ferry to the other side of the loch, but the timetable wasn't in our favour.

If we had decided to head home at this point, I might have better memories of the day.

We had originally planned to continue to see a dam that looked like something out of Andor ([Sloy Dam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2eb61mpQe3pnJEfk7)). So, we continued on.

There was an immediate and dramatic uptick in elevation. Then it started raining and didn't stop. The dam was impressive but by the time we reached it I couldn't have cared less. I was actively trying to avoid throwing up.

On the way back I was miserable. Sick and cold and tired. Jack started flagging too. We grabbed a Co-op dinner and collapsed back at the B&B.
