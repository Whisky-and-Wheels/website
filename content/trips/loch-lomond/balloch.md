It was the weekend of Daylight Savings and our B&B was on a farm. The owner told us they'd been milking the cows slightly earlier each day throughout the week to prepare for the jump. Apparently, cows don't like it if you just show up an hour earlier for milking one day, Daylight Savings or not.

We were ready to go early, excited for a bike along Loch Lomond, but still tired from yesterday's travel. I was also recovering from getting sick earlier in the week.

The excitement carried us through the first half of the day. We couldn't have dreamed up a better ride. The weather was overcast but not rainy. The clouds were works of art. There was a proper cycle path along the loch (no worries about cars). And it's mostly flat!

We stopped for tea and coffee at an adorable little blue coffee truck in a location that also had a unicorn sculpture and a map of a fairie trail ([Sassanach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gJtydQg2yafoJ4Vq9)).

Lunch was at a tourist centre with a cafe ([Bonnie & Ben Takeaway](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zc6CviTWsxAJShSaA)). We thought about [taking a ferry cruise](https://www.cruiselochlomond.co.uk/) to the other side of the loch, but the timetable wasn't in our favour.

If we had decided to head home at this point, I might have better memories of the day. But we originally planned to continue on to see a dam that looked like something out of Andor ([Sloy Dam](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2eb61mpQe3pnJEfk7)).

So, we continued on.

There was an immediate and dramatic uptick in elevation. Then it started raining and didn't stop. The dam was impressive but by the time we reached it I couldn't have cared less. I was trying to avoid throwing up.

On the way back I was miserable. Sick and cold and tired. Jack started flagging too. We grabbed a Co-op dinner and collapsed back at the B&B.
